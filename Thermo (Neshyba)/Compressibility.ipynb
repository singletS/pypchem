    "Everybody knows that gases are compressible - they become denser when the pressure goes up. But not all gases do this in exactly the same way.  That's because a gas's compressibility is influenced by intermolecular forces, which we know vary from gas to gas.  That, in turn, implies something rather intriguing to a physical chemist: it means that by studying gas density, we can gain insight into how gas molecules interact!  That is one reason why physical chemists have long been interested in analyzing gas density.\n",
    "\n",

For example, the mole density of air is shown in Fig. 1. You can see that isotherms of the mole density show an increase in density with pressure, but this increase isn't linear. To a physical chemist, that's a good thing: it means there are intermolecular forces at work here!\n",

You know that gases behave ideally in the low-pressure limit, for example, so you would expect $Z \\rightarrow 1$ as $P \\rightarrow 0$.  As can be seen from Figure 2, it does!  Now look carefully at the isotherms in Fig. 2. At low temperatures (eg., at 150 K), <em>Z</em> first dips down, then goes up, with increasing pressure. At high temperatures, <em>Z</em> does not exhibit this dip. The temperature at which a gas transitions between these two patterns is called the <em>Boyle temperature</em>, $T_{Boyle}$."
