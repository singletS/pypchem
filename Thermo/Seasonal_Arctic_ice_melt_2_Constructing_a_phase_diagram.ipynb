    "We have argued that human activity has changed the pattern of sea ice melt in the Arctic through the qualitative idea of ice-albedo feedback. Confidence in making predictions about the future requires quantitative treatment as well. In this CGI, you will explore this idea in two ways. First, you will estimate how _much_ energy is required to effect the seasonal melt of Arctic ice from April to September. Secondly, you will construct a phase diagram of water based on fundamental thermodynamic properties of water.  "

    "There is a useful interpretation of the Clausius-Clapeyron curves in your phase diagram. At any given temperature, the Clausius-Clapeyron curve gives the vapor pressure required to keep a given sample of water in perfect equilibrium. If the actual vapor pressure at any given moment exceeds this value, we say the system is _supersaturated_ (too much water vapor). The system will respond by condensing some of the excess water vapor to liquid form. If, in contrast, the actual vapor pressure falls below the Clausius-Clapeyron value, we say the system is _subsaturated_, and some of the liquid will evaporate. To take a specific example, suppose a sample of liquid water at 275 K is exposed to air with a partial pressure of water of 725 Pa. Is the system subsaturated, supersaturated, or in equlibrium?
