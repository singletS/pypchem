    "Human activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere in such a way that the temperature of the planet has increased. Polar regions have undergone greater increases in temperature than midlatitudes, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Recent research has also shown that this amplified warming has a significant impact on weather at lower latitudes, causing severe episodes of drought and heavy rainfall in North America and Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polar ampification is largely due to a phenomenon called _ice-albedo feedback_. Ice-albedo feedback works as follows: Ice and snow have a high _albedo_, meaning those surfaces efficiently reflect radiation away from the earth's surface. But the water that comes from _melted_ snow and ice has a lower albedo, meaning it absorbs more solar radiation. That, in turn,  warms the surface a little more, which causes more melting, and so on: a postive feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this means that sea ice extent in polar regions is a key climate driver. To that end, climate scientists have taken careful measurements of the seasonal melting and freezing of ice in polar regions, as well as trends in that melting and freezing from year to year. Here, you will examine some of this data. "

    "\n",
    "One way to get at Arctic ice thickness is by taking measurements of Arctic ice _volume_ in addition to Arctic ice _extent_. Then you could estimate the thickness of the ice. This follows from simple dimensional analysis: volume has units $m^3$, while extent has units $m^2$ (in SI units). So the ratio between them is a measure of Arctic ice thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this CGI, you'll infer Arctic ice thickness from sea ice extent and volume data. In doing so, you'll develop familiarity with the seasonal and year-to-year patterns, skill at visualizing and analyzing the available data, and perhaps glean some insight into the mechanisms behind the seasonal melt of Arctic sea ice."
