    "The purpose of any heat engine is to generate a useable form of energy (such as electricity) from the heat extracted from a hot reservoir (such as a furnace). A _Carnot heat engine_ is a theoretical heat engine in which one imagines taking an ideal gas through a sequence of reversible expansions and contractions of an ideal gas that ends up with the gas in the exact same state it started in. This sequence is called a _Carnot cycle_, and is often depicted in an _indicator diagram_ such as Fig. 1. The upper curve of this cycle (from point A to B) is the isothermal heat extraction leg that gets the engine started: during this leg, the gas is in thermal contact with the hot reservoir and extracts heat from it. Subsequent legs of the cycle trace out a clockwise closed loop in this diagram, as indicated by the arrows in the figure. The cycle is called a _closed thermodynamic cycle_ because the gas returns to its initial state at the end. \n",
