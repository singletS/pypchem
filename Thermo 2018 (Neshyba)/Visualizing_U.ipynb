    "Internal energy is usually written as a function of V and T, designated by the notation $U=U(V,T)$. Conceptually, this energy is very straightforward: it is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all molecules in a given sample. For an ideal, monatomic gas, the internal energy depends linearly on the temperature,\n",

The form of Eq. 1 can be deduced from the equipartition theorem: since the atoms making up a monatomic ideal gas have, on average, ${1 \\over 2} RT$ of translational kinetic energy for each of three spatial dimensions, the total is ${3 \\over 2} RT$ (per mole).\n",

However, $f_{vib}$  generally has a nonlinear temperature dependence. That’s a quantum-mechanical phenomenon, as it turns out: as temperature increases, more kinds (“modes”) of vibrational motion become thermally accessible. In practice, this means if you make a graph of $U$ as a function of $T$, for atoms you can expect a straight line, but for molecules you can expect some curvature! An experimentally-derived example of U as a function of T for fluorine ($F_2$) gas is shown in Fig. 1. Careful inspection will reveal a slight curvature in this plot: the slope increases with increasing temperature, implying a nonlinear temperature dependence.\n"

    "You may have noticed there isn’t any volume dependence in Eqs. 1 and 2. There is a physical meaning behind this idea: since the ideal gas law neglects molecular size and intermolecular attractions, we say that the atoms or molecules in an ideal gas don’t know about one another. So you can think of Eqs. 1 and 2 as being the energy of $n$ moles of isolated, non-interacting gas molecules.\n",

When two gas molecules approach one another from a distance, their first interaction is a mutual attraction. When they get too close, however, they push apart.

    "So the upshot is, we can expect the ideal gas equation to be a good approximation to real gas behavior when the gas is placed in a large volume, but not when the gas is confined to a small volume. A different line of thinking (not obvious from the present considerations) leads to the expectation that the ideal gas law should work well at high temperature, but not at low temperature. In fact, as you know, gases condense to liquids at low enough temperatures. This is due to the intermolecular attractions seen in Fig. 2.\n",
