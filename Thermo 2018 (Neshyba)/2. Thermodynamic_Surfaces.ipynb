    "An _equation of state_ is any algebraic expression that relates\n",
    "thermodynamic variables to one another. You’re probably familiar with the\n",
    "equation of state for an ideal gas, written algebraically as $PV=nRT$.\n",
    "Here, the pressure, volume, and temperature are thermodynamic variables; _n_\n",
    "tells you how much of the gas there is, and _R_ is the gas constant. It’s\n",
    "clear from this equation that once we know any two thermodynamic\n",
    "variables, we can get the third, e.g.,\n",

    "\n",
    "We haven’t changed much in writing this; it’s still the equation of state for an ideal gas. But by writing _P(V,T)_ on the left hand side, we are signaling that we’re thinking about pressure as a _state function_ (because it depends on _T_ and _V_). Variables _T_ and _V_, the independent variables in this equation, define a two-dimensional _state space_. Equation 1 can be thought of geometrically as a surface in two dimensions. Josiah Willard Gibbs called these _thermodynamic surfaces_. James Clerk Maxwell famously made three plaster models of a thermodynamic surface, and gave one as a present to Gibbs. A photo of one is shown in Fig. 1.\n",

The plaster model Maxwell gave to Gibbs showed the energy (_U_) as a function of the volume and entropy (_V_ and _S_) of an idealized water-like substance, which we would write shorthand as _U(V,S)_. But an important point is that _all_ substances (real or idealized) are characterized by thermodynamic surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you visualize what the thermodynamic surface _P(V,T)_ of a gas looks like? One approach is to imagine how pressure behaves as a function of each variable separately. That is exactly what early investigators did. Two 17th century British scientists, Boyle and Hooke, found that when the volume of a gas is changed isothermally (temperature held constant), the gas pressure goes as the inverse of the volume. A century and a half later, French chemist Gay-Lussac reported that when the temperature of a gas is changed isochorically (volume held constant), the pressure goes up in direct proportion to the temperature. These properties are also easily obtained from Eq. 1, by the way, but Gay-Lussac, Boyle, and Hooke didn’t have that advantage.\n",
