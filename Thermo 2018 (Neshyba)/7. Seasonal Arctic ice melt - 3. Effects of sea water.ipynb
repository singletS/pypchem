    "We have argued that human activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere, changed the pattern of sea ice melt in the Arctic, and that proper modeling of climate depends on quantitative representation of the thermodynamics of sea ice. We have estimated the energy needed to effect the seasonal melting of Arctic sea ice. In this CGI, we will refine this idea a little. Specifically, we'll be exploring what difference it makes that the ice is forming from seawater, and is in equilibrium with it. Both are definite, measureable effects that could potentially impact climate predictions."

    "But this phase diagram refers to _pure_ water, whereas sea water is salty: on average, there are 35 grams of salt, mostly NaCl, in every kilogram of seawater. What difference does that make? One difference is that ice freezes at a lower temperature when it is exposed to salty water (this is why salt is sometimes applied to icy roads). Another difference is that the reduction in freezing point will cause a slight change in the enthalpy of melting, $\\Delta H_{fus}$. We'll take up the theory behind these two effects next."

The usual way of obtaining the latter is to assume you have 1 liter of solution, which contains 55.5 moles of water along with some solute. The moles of solute equals the molarity of the salt (since we're assuming 1 liter of solution) times what is called the _van't Hoff_ factor, usually designated as $i$. The van't Hoff factor takes into account the fact when some solutes dissolve, multiple particles enter the solution. Thus $i=1$ if the solute is sucrose, but $i=2$ if the solute is NaCl, etc. \n",
